# GridStrument

An experiment in MIDI control via android touch events.

Uses the nmj library, requires the mnet midi host app. http://www.humatic.de/htools/

Inspired by the LinnStrument http://www.rogerlinndesign.com/linnstrument.html and Madrona Labs SoundPlane http://madronalabs.com/soundplane.

Is it possible for an Android tablet App to give a similar experience?  Let's see.

## Notes

Consider https://github.com/kshoji/USB-MIDI-Driver?  No, that is a Android<->USB MIDI device connector.
